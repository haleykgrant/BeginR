# Outline {.unnumbered}

This section was developed based on [this resource](https://github.com/rstudio/learnr/tree/main/inst/tutorials/ex-setup-r/ex-setup-r.Rmd). The goal is to make sure you have R and Rstudio installed on your computer and make sure you have a folder set up for this class to make your semester go smoother.


This section will help you set up your computer to use R. It is for you if you need to:

-   Install R on your computer
-   Install the RStudio IDE
-   Get set up with R projects

You can skip this section if you've already done these things.
