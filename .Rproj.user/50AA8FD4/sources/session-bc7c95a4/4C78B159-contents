## R Projects

R projects make it easy to keep files relating to the same content organized. I recommend making a folder and an R project for this class. This will allow you to keep all of your data files, notes, and homework code in one (organized) place on your computer.

### Guide to RStudio IDE and R Projects

Below is a great video from [RLadiesSydney](https://rladiessydney.org/). Watch the video for a description of the layout of the RStudio interface and a demonstration for how to create an R project on your computer.

### Making a New R Project

Making an R project is a great idea to keep files like data, code files, etc. together. I like to make a new R project for every new research project, class, outside project, etc. that I use R for. 

By making a new project, you will help R find the files you need for your analyses and keep everything organized in one place. Go ahead and make an R project for this material on your own computer now!


That's it! The next chapter will be about using data types, using functions, and downloading packages in R.
