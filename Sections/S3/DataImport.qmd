Now that we understand where files may be stored and how to tell R how to find them, we can move on to importing the data files into R. We will split this chapter based on the type of file you want to import.

## Importing a csv file

To import a csv file to R, we can use the function `read.csv()`. There is a similar function in the `tidyverse` package called `read_csv()` that we can also use. We'll go ahead and use the tidyverse version.

The syntax to use this function is:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
`name_for_data = read_csv("path_to_data")`
:::

-   Here `name_for_data` is any name you choose to call the data frame object that you will be creating with the `read_csv()` function. It can be helpful to give it a name that is relevant to the data, but you can call it whatever you want (with some limits--for example, the name can't start with a number).

-   `"path_to_data"` is the file path that will tell R where to look for your data. You can either provide the function with an absolute path to the file (starting with the root directory of your computer) or a relative path, starting at the current working directory. 

::: callout-warning
## Assigning a name

**Warning:** Naming the object is very important!

If you forget to choose a name for your data frame, R will import the data and print it, but it won't save it as an object. If you just use `read_csv()` without the `name_for_data =` part, you won't be able to manipulate or analyze the data.
:::

::: callout-warning
## Duplicate names

**Another warning:** If you import two data sets and accidentally give them the same name, *the one you import second will overwrite the first one*! Sometimes this is useful; for example, if you just want to make a change to a dataset (more on this later). But be careful and when in doubt, give new data frames new names!
:::

Let's try reading in the "cdc_samp.csv" file and give the data frame the name `cdc`. You may need to add an extra line of code to get this to work (think back to our last tutorial about R functions and packages).

```{webr-r}

# read in the data file "cdc_samp.csv"
cdc = read_csv("Data/cdc_samp.csv")
```

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Hint (if you get an error)

If you get the following error:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
[Error: could not find function "read_csv"]{style="color: #db4133; font-family: 'Monaco'; font-weight: 500;"}
:::

you forgot to load the tidyverse package!

Add a line of code above your read_csv() line to load the tidyverse (`library(tidyverse)`).
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution

```{webr-r}
#| warning: false
# load tidyverse package first
library(tidyverse)

# read in the data file "cdc_samp.csv"
cdc = read_csv("Data/cdc_samp.csv")
```
:::

### Making sure it worked

Great! If you were able to get the code chunk above to run without any error messages, then the code should have worked and we should now have an R object named `cdc` in our environment that we can work with.

If we were working in RStudio, we could check to make sure there is an object named `cdc` under the "Data" heading of the Environment tab (in the upper right-hand corner for most RStudio setups if you didn't change the panel layout). Since we aren't working in RStudio, we will use a function to make sure our `read_csv()` code worked. The function we will use is the `exists()` function and, as the name suggests, it just tells us if the object we are checking exists in our environment or not. It will return a logical value `TRUE` if the object exists and `FALSE` if it does not. The function expects the name of the object in "quotation marks."

```{webr-r}
# check if the cdc data frame exists
exists("cdc")

```

If you were able to run the code above, the output here should be TRUE. If your output says FALSE, go back to the previous section and make sure you can run the code without producing any errors.

## Importing an Excel file

We've successfully imported a csv file, but what if we get a different file type? For example, a lot of people store data in Excel. Can R handle those files? Yep! But we're going to need to use a new package called the `readxl` package.

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## Reminder: Installing `readxl`

Remember that if you don't have this package installed on your local computer, you'll need to install it once before you can load and use it. I've already installed it here, but remember that to install the package you can just run `install.packages("readxl")` in your console in RStudio.
:::

Once we have the `readxl` package loaded, the syntax is very similar to `read_csv()` from above. There are a few different functions that could work from this package, but the most generic one is `read_excel()`. The syntax is:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
`name_for_data = read_excel("path_to_data")`
:::

Let's try it using our 'dds.xlsx' file!

```{webr-r}
#| message: false
# load the readxl package 
library(readxl)

# save the data contained in dds.xlsx under the name `dds`
dds = read_excel("Data/dds.xlsx")


```

::: {.callout-note icon="false" appearance="simple"}
#### Exercise:

Try checking to see if this code worked (like we did above) by checking if an object called "dds" exists in our environment.

```{webr-r}
# check if the dds data frame exists


```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" }
## Solution

Remember to put `"dds"` in quotation marks!

```{webr-r}
#| warning: false
# check if the dds data frame exists
exists("dds")
```
:::
:::

Once again, this should output the logical value TRUE if the code worked properly. Once you have the `readxl` package, importing Excel files works just like importing csv files!

## Importing R data files

There is one other type of file that we will use from time to time in this class. This is a special kind of file called an R data file that saves R objects. **The syntax is slightly different for this kind of file.**

The syntax for importing an R data file is:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
`load("path_to_data")`
:::

::: callout-warning
## load()

Notice how we didn't include anything on the left side of the `load()` function here. We didn't give the data a name!
:::

The reason we don't assign names to data loaded from an R data file is because **these objects already come with a name**. Since these are R objects that were saved specifically in a file format that R understands, they keep the name that they were given when they were first created in R. So how do we know what the name is? We can add an extra argument to this function called `verbose`. The syntax will become:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
`load("path_to_data", verbose = TRUE)`
:::

This tells R to print out the name of the data object once it is loaded so we know what to call it.

Let's see an example of this using our 'census.rda' file.

```{webr-r}
# load in the data
# add verbose = TRUE so the object name gets printed
load("Data/census.rda", verbose = TRUE)

```

We can see the message:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
[Loading objects:<br>  census]{style="font-family: 'Monaco'; font-weight: 500; display: inline-block; text-align: left;"}
:::

This is telling us that the object we loaded came with the name `census`. This is the name we should use to refer to that data object.

```{webr-r}
# check if the census data frame exists


```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Note: file names vs object names

The name of the R object doesn't have to match with the file name like it did in this example. The file name "census.rda" and the object name `census` are two independent things. However, it can be helpful to have the file name and object name match, so they often will by convention.
:::

## Other file types

There are other types of files that you may want to import into R. These include text files (.txt) and files from other statistical software packages like SAS (.sas7bdat) or stata (.dta). The syntax for reading in these files is very similar to reading in csv or Excel files so we won't go into these data types in detail. There are lots of helpful tutorials and R documentation online if you ever need them (for example, [this page](https://dk81.github.io/dkmathstats_site/ranalysis-readfile-types.html) goes through reading in files from multiple sources).

## Viewing Your Data

Great! We've now imported our first few data files into R. But how do we see the data we imported?


### The head() function

Again, in RStudio, you should be able to see a new object in your 'Environment' tab in the upper-right quadrant of your screen when you import a new data set. Within this tab, there is an option to view the data by clicking the small white box that appears next to the object name. Since we're working on the web, we'll go ahead and use a different function to take a look at the top few rows of the dataset. The function that will allow us to do this is `head()` that shows us the top few entries of a data frame, vector, or list.

```{webr-r}
# show top few rows of the data set `cdc`
head(cdc)

```

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Hint (if you get an error)

If you get the following error:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
[Error: object 'cdc' not found]{style="color: #db4133; font-family: 'Monaco'; font-weight: 500;"}
:::

this is R's way of telling you that you don't currently have an object loaded into your environment called 'cdc'.

When you see an error like this, you should make sure the code used to import the data worked properly and that you don't have any spelling errors (R is case sensitive so you have to be very careful to spell things exactly correctly).

Make sure you were able to successfully run the code above with the `read_csv()` function without any errors before running this code block.
:::

Awesome! Here we see the top 6 rows of the `cdc` data frame. There are 9 columns: [genhlth, exerany, hlthplan, smoke100, height, weight, wtdesire, age, gender.]{style="font-family: Monaco;"}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## `tail()` function

If you want to look at the *last* few entries of an R object, there is a similar function to the `head()` function called `tail()`.
:::

### The skim() function

Another way we can start to take a look at the data is to use a function from the R package `skmir`. The function is called `skim` and gives us a nice overview of the contents included in our data.

```{webr-r}
#| warning: false
#| context: interactive
#| autorun: true
# load skimr library
library(skimr)
```

```{webr-r}
# use the skim() function on the cdc data
skim(cdc)

```

This function breaks our columns into groups based on the type of variable they are. Here we see that [genhlth]{style="font-family: Monaco;"} and [gender]{style="font-family: Monaco;"} are characters and the rest are being treated as numeric (even though it looks like we may have a few other binary variables that were coded as 0/1---more on this later). The summary information gives us a snapshot of the contents of each column in the data. More information about the specific sections of the output can be found below.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Understanding `skim()` output

The columns for categorical variables are:

| Attribute     | Description                                                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| n_missing     | the number of rows with missing value (NA) in the corresponding columns |
| complete_rate | proportion of rows that are not missing (not NAs)                       |
| min           | the minimum character length of values in the column                    |
| max           | the maximum character length of values in the column                    |
| empty         | the number of empty characters in the column                            |
| n_unique      | the number of unique values in the column                               |
| whitespace    | the number of rows containing only white space in the column            |

The columns for numeric variables are:

| Attribute     | Description                                                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| n_missing     | the number of rows with missing value (NA) in the corresponding columns   |
| complete_rate | proportion of rows that are not missing (not NAs)                         |
| mean          | the mean (average) value of the non-missing values in the column          |
| sd            | the standard deviation of the non-missing values in the column            |
| p0            | the minimum value observed in the column                                  |
| p25           | the 25th percentile of values observed in the column                      |
| p50           | the median (50th percentile) of values observed in the column             |
| p75           | the 75th percentile of values observed in the column                      |
| p100          | the maximum value observed in the column                                  |
| hist          | a histogram showing the shape of the distribution of values in the column |
:::

### The View() function

When we're working in RStudio, we can also use the `View()` function to look at an entire data frame. This will open up a spreadsheet-like data viewer in a new tab in RStudio where you can scroll through all the rows and columns in a data frame. We can't use this here or in R Markdown files (which can knit to PDF or HTML, for example) because it requires opening a new data viewer tab. It is a useful function when you're working interactively in RStudio, though!
